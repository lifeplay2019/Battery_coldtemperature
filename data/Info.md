## File Name
For example: 18650_-30_dc_1.xlsx

18650:  Battery Type\
-30:    Temperature while doing the cycle\
dc:     cycle of discharging\
_1:     the selected cycle used for the tested.\
N10:    negative 10 degree celsius\
P25:    sample for the room temperature -- positive 25 degree celsius 

* All the rest of the data has been storage in the PC for future test.

### Reminder:
* the charging voltage usually would not reach as it set to be (For example: nominal voltage is 4.2, we charge at 4.25v usuall it can not reach toward 4.25v.)
